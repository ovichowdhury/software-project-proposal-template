**5 Key Stages of Requirements Engineering: A Practical Guide**

Every project needs a clear roadmap, and that roadmap begins with well-defined requirements. Without them, teams are left wandering aimlessly, often making up tasks as they go. So, what are requirements exactly?

> "Requirements are the wants and needs of stakeholders clearly defined with acceptance criteria." — Association for Project Management (APM)

Requirements engineering is the structured process of understanding and documenting those wants and needs. It consists of five critical stages:

---

### 1. Requirements Elicitation

This isn’t about just listing what users say they want — it’s about drawing out their real needs. The term "elicitation" implies an active process, often using a combination of methods such as:

* **Brainstorming** – Promoting creativity before narrowing ideas down.
* **Interviews** – One-on-one sessions to understand goals and frustrations.
* **Focus Groups** – Group discussions to surface common themes.
* **Observation** – Watching users perform tasks to uncover real workflows.
* **Surveys** – Gathering large-scale, quantifiable input.
* **Prototyping** – Creating early mockups for quick feedback.
* **Document Analysis & Personas** – Reviewing existing data and creating user profiles to support empathetic design.

These techniques align with the "Understand" phase of design thinking, helping teams empathize with real user challenges.

### 2. Requirements Analysis

Once gathered, requirements must be analyzed to ensure they’re valid, comprehensive, and feasible. It's where most project errors originate if not done well.

Key analysis tasks include:

* **Categorization:**

  * *Functional Requirements* – What the system does.
  * *Non-functional Requirements* – How it performs (e.g., security, scalability).

* **Prioritization:**

  * Using the **MoSCoW** method (Must, Should, Could, Won’t) to identify what’s essential.

* **Filtering:**

  * Eliminate duplicates, ambiguities, and inconsistencies. Requirements should be complete, measurable, traceable, and feasible.

### 3. Requirements Documentation

Now it’s time to capture everything clearly. This documentation serves as a reference for all project stakeholders.

A solid requirements document typically includes:

* Project background and objectives
* Glossary of terms
* Functional and non-functional requirements
* Visual models (e.g., diagrams or workflows)

**User stories** are often used here, written in a simple, structured format:

> As a \[type of user], I want \[feature] so that \[benefit].

Example:

> As a blind user, I need the site to be screen-reader compatible so that I can access government services.

High-quality user stories should meet defined criteria: clarity, feasibility, testability, and user-centric focus.

### 4. Requirements Validation

Before moving forward, it's crucial to check that your requirements actually reflect what stakeholders need. Validation methods include:

* **Reviews** – Walkthrough sessions to identify gaps or contradictions.
* **Prototyping** – Testing low-fidelity designs with users.
* **Test Cases** – Writing validations for each requirement to ensure they’re actionable.

Validated requirements should be:

* Complete
* Consistent
* Realistic
* Verifiable

This step prevents costly revisions later and ensures the solution is aligned with expectations.

### 5. Requirements Management

Projects evolve, and so do requirements. This phase is about tracking and controlling those changes.

Key concepts include:

* **Traceability:**

  * Requirements should be traceable from origin to implementation and aligned with business goals.

* **Configuration Management:**

  * Maintain version control, change logs, and ensure quality as updates are made.

* **Methodology Alignment:**

  * *Waterfall*: Requirements are tightly controlled.
  * *Agile*: Flexible, adaptive, with continuous feedback loops (e.g., product backlogs).

Regardless of the methodology, active and transparent management of requirements is essential for project success.

### Final Thoughts

Requirements engineering isn’t just for large, complex systems. Even small digital projects benefit greatly from applying these principles.

By following these five interdependent stages — **elicitation, analysis, documentation, validation, and management** — you reduce risks, enhance clarity, and build better, more user-focused solutions.

So, the next time someone says, "Let’s start building!" — make sure you’ve started with the requirements first.
